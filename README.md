# Learn React: To-Do App
Makin' a to-do app to keep learning React

Inspiration: https://habitica.com/ 

## Feature List
Some dev notes for myself to track while I build
- Title field: plain text
- Description field: expandable plain text, see about allowing markdown or at least registering line breaks
- Checklist repeater: who wouldn't want to nest to-dos inside of other to-dos?
- Due date field: would prefer a calendar selector, may rely on the browser in-built one but willing to look into libraries
- Modal: user opens this to edit all the above fields for each to-do
- Options menu for each to-do: edit, to top, to bottom, delete
- Drag and drop? https://dndkit.com/ - look at presets > sortable, that's prett much exactly what we want. Alternatives would be adding up/down arrows to the card, which would be tedious for long lists but might be worth going for if the dnd library doesn't play as nice as we hoped
